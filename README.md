  - Use of modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.
  - Accessibility features to support users with disabilities, including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Redux: State management for React applications.
  - React Router: Declarative routing for React applications.
  - Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
  - Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS: CSS frameworks for responsive design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project for full control.
